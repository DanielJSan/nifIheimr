### ðŸ‘‹
I'm a second year Computer Engineering student at USAL, I've been coding casually for 5 years or so and started seriously 2 years ago when I finished high school. I don't enjoy programming that much currently but I like tinkering and doing stupid shit with my knowledge. 


I'm interested in 3D graphics and game development, audio related plugins and anything related to graphic design such as web design or user interfaces. I usually go the extra mile on my assignments (those which I manage to finish in time at least) to create a visually pleasing experience for the user and I might focus on this particular field when I get the chance to do so.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on surviving my finals
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning not quite as much as I'd hope to
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Don't

### Languages and Tools:
- Main: C/C++
- Usable level: Java, Python, MatLab, JavaScript, Bash, Arduino
- I've used them but I don't know what the hell I'm doing 99% of the time: Motorola 6809 Assembler, Verilog
