### ðŸ‘‹
I'm a second year Computer Engineering student at USAL, I've been coding casually for 5 years or so and started seriously 2 years ago when I finished high school. I don't enjoy programming that much currently but I like tinkering and doing stupid shit with my knowledge. 


I'm interested in 3D graphics and game development, audio related plugins and anything related to graphic design such as web design or user interfaces. I usually go the extra mile on my assignments (those which I manage to finish in time at least) to create a visually pleasing experience for the user and I might focus on this particular field when I get the chance to do so.
